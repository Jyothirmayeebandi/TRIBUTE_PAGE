      <h2 class="side">About</h2>
      Mahendra Singh Dhoni, often referred to as M. S. Dhoni, is a prominent
      Indian cricketer who held the captaincy of the Indian cricket team in
      limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016 and in Test cricket from 2008 to
      2014. Known for his aggressive batting style as a right-handed
      middle-order batsman and his adept wicket-keeping skills, Dhoni is widely
      acclaimed as one of the finest finishers in limited-overs cricket history.
      His ability to steer the team to victory in challenging situations has
      earned him immense respect in the cricketing world. Dhoni marked his debut
      in One Day International (ODI) cricket in December 2004 during a match
      against Bangladesh. His exceptional skills and leadership qualities
      quickly propelled him into the national spotlight. Just a year later, in a
      Test match against Sri Lanka, Dhoni showcased his talent in the longer
      format of the game, further solidifying his position as a key player in
      the Indian cricket team.
